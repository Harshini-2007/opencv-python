I've built a system that uses OpenCV to detect the number of fingers I'm showing to a camera, and then controls a set of LEDs based on these gestures.<br>

The project integrates:<br>
* **OpenCV:** For real-time hand and finger tracking.<br>
* **AIML:** To interpret certain gestures and potentially provide basic interactive responses.<br>
* **Arduino Uno:** To receive signals and control the LED patterns.<br>

For instance, showing one finger makes a single LED pulse, two fingers create a chasing light effect, and a thumbs-up triggers a rainbow color sequence! It was a fun challenge optimizing the finger detection for different lighting, and I learned a ton about integrating these different technologies.
